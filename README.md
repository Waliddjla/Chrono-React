# [Chrono](https://walid-chrono.netlify.app/) - React Stopwatch Application

Chrono is a versatile React web application that serves as a stopwatch, allowing you to accurately measure time intervals. With the ability to manage sessions and breaks, customize the theme, and control the stopwatch with start and reset functionalities, Chrono offers a comprehensive timekeeping solution.

## Features

- Session and Break Management: Chrono enables you to track time intervals for sessions and breaks. Whether you need to time your work sessions, exercise routines, or any other timed activities, Chrono has got you covered. Easily switch between sessions and breaks to maintain productivity and efficiency.

- Theme Customization: With Chrono, you have the flexibility to customize the theme according to your preferences. The application provides plus and minus buttons to manipulate the theme, allowing you to adjust colors, fonts, or other stylistic elements to create an aesthetically pleasing stopwatch experience.

- Start and Reset Functionality: Chrono allows you to start and stop the stopwatch with a simple click. When you're ready to begin timing, just press the start button, and Chrono will begin tracking the elapsed time. If you need to reset the stopwatch, the reset button will bring the timer back to its initial state.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
